TODO: create note splashes, hold cover effects.

Change logic for sustain notes. 
Delete sustain on key press and make a fake sustain that perfectly aligns with the middle of the arrow
Then, add the hold cover effect over that.

ALSO IMPLEMENT: Give bot strums a state too; it will make it easier to handle animations

Song score, health bar, gameoverstate.
Create combo popups, combo count.
COUNTDOWN.
Then, maybe work on camGame?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create strumline component, implement creating strums --
Implement user input; what do we do when user tries to play the note? If they miss it? Look into using events for this.

Implement reading from song charts
Implement spawning notes; is this the conductors' job?
